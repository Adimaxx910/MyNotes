	npx is a package runner tool that comes with Node.js and npm 	(Node Package Manager). 
_____________________________________________________________
2.)create an app foldder
	create two files index.js and _layout.js
	inside layout.js  put this code
		
		import { Stack } from "expo-router";
		const layout=()=>{
		   return(
 		  <Stack/>
   		)}
		export default layout;

      	
The Stack component from expo-router is used to create a stack of navigation screens in React Native. This allows you to navigate between screens in a hierarchical manner, with the ability to go back and forth between screens in the stack.
why we use this bcos::
	To create a simple navigation flow, such as a stack of onboarding 	screens or a stack of screens for a specific feature in your app.

import React from "react";
import { Stack } from "expo-router";

const Screen1 = () => {
  return <div>Screen 1</div>;
};

const Screen2 = () => {
  return <div>Screen 2</div>;
};

const layout = () => {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Screen1 />
      <Screen2 />
    </Stack>
  );
};

export default layout;
-----------------------------------------

                                               In Layout.js

import {view,text} from 'react-native';

const Home= ()=>{
   return(
    <view>
        <text>Home</text>
    </view>
   )
}

export default Home;
